Solution:
SQL query to identify the id's with highest salary per department:
SELECT id
FROM
    DEMO.EMPLOYEE
WHERE
    (department , salary) IN (
                              SELECT department, MAX(salary)
                              FROM DEMO.EMPLOYEE
                              GROUP BY department
        );

Bonus tasks:
1. Create table statement:
CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE (
    id INT,
    department VARCHAR(50),
    firstname VARCHAR(50),
    lastname VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    salary FLOAT,
    reg_date TIMESTAMP
);

2. Second possible solution
SELECT id
FROM DEMO.EMPLOYEE OUTER_EMP
WHERE
    salary = (SELECT MAX(salary)
                    FROM
                        DEMO.EMPLOYEE INNER_EMP
                    WHERE
                        OUTER_EMP.department = INNER_EMP.department);
